# akita_genesis/modules/__init__.py
# Initialization for the modules package.

# This file makes Python treat the 'modules' directory as a sub-package.
# You could optionally import specific classes or functions from the modules
# here to make them available directly under the 'modules' namespace, e.g.:
#
# from .communication import CommunicationManager
# from .tasks import TaskManager
#
# However, it's often cleaner to keep this file empty or minimal and
# have other parts of the application import directly from the specific module, e.g.:
# from akita_genesis.modules.communication import CommunicationManager
